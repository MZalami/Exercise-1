# Exercise 1 - Written assignment

In the *Introduction to Sustainability* and *Introduction to Spatial Data Science* lessons this week, we have learned 
a few basic concepts about sustainable development goals and modern geospatial analytics. 
In this written assignment, the idea is to reflect a bit of the things that we have learned from your own perspective.

For this exercise, we recommend that you first write your text into Google Docs (or some other text editor), and once you are ready, paste the text into this Markdown document located at **your personal copy of the exercise** (e.g. `exercise-1-htenkanen`). You can add your text here using the editing functionalities of GitHub: click `Edit`, then modify this document, and commit (i.e. save) your changes (to be able to do that, you need to add a commit message like `Update docs`). 

## Reflections on sustainability (10 points)

Write 0.5-2 pages of text in English where you reflect your own life and thoughts about sustainability.
To help you get going, here are some questions that you might touch upon in your text:

 - What does sustainability mean to you?
 - Did your idea / understanding about sustainability evolve somehow after the introductory presentation?
 - Are there (or have there been) some behaviors/actions in your life that you have changed due to sustainability reasons?
 - How do you think that as a *spatial data scientist/engineer* you could help to make a difference in terms of sustainability? 
 E.g. in your current / previous / future job. It does not need to be anything grandiose. Small things matter as well. 

Notice that the above questions are just some examples about the topics that you could write about. 
You do not need to answer them all, and you can also invent your own topics/questions that you want to
write about. The important part is that you start thinking about sustainability and reflect it from your own 
perspective.
